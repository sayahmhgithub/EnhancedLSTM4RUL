# EnhancedLSTM4RUL
In this enhanced deep LSTM approach, clustering is performed for all collected sensors data and operational monitoring information, using Gaussian distributions. These Gaussian mixtures clustering over the entire collected data leads to an adequate and specific deep neural network for RUL prediction.
